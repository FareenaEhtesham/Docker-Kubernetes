//DESCRIPTION:
go to the container by "kubectl exec my-pod-pv-pvc -it sh" and save data [my-pod-pv-pvc is the name of pod where i used pv and pvc].

As i use persistentvolumeclaimpolicy = Delete so i delete my pvc automatically my pv delete but data/files which i saved in container
present in cluster 

minikube ssh (go to the cluster level) then go to the host path (define in yaml file of persistent volume) and it shows
the data you save at container level although pv and pvc delete
